# cursus_honorum
A simulation for playing with the ideas behind the cursus honorum.  A hobby-level repo,
do fork and play around.  Do not expect PRs to be merged.

Make an (python3) environment, install the dependencies from requirements.txt, then `python cursus.py`.
You'll get a lot of terminal output, and a log file in the same directory.  The terminal output is the
dry account of what's happened through the years the sim ran.  The log file has some details.

It uses esper, and models some things about elites vying for magistracies in a Roman Middle Republic-ish setting.
I'm drawing on Dr. Bret Devereaux's "A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry" blog posts, at https://acoup.blog/, and
the Dr. Fiona Radford and Dr. Peta Greenfield "Partial Historians" podcast, at https://partialhistorians.com/, and
text and images from places like the Wikipedia article for "Cursus honorum", at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum

This is a playful experiment, and I might fiddle with it more in that light.  On reading and hearing about this
set of customary rules, I wondered how that might play out, and this is the immediate result.
Play around with it yourself, see how 100 years goes if you change the rules, or try to incorporate additional structures
or random events.  What do you find?
